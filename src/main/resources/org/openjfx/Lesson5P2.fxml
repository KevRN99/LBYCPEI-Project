Such a collision is called an elastic collision.&#13;&#13;• A collision in which the total kinetic energy after the collision is less than before the collision is called an inelastic collision.&#13;&#13;• An inelastic collision in which the colliding bodies stick together and move as one body after the collision is called a completely inelastic collision.&#13;&#13;• Classifying collisions:&#13;○ A collision in which kinetic energy is conserved is called elastic.&#13;○ A collision in which the total kinetic energy decreases is called inelastic.&#13;○ When the two bodies have a common final velocity, we say that the collision is completely inelastic." textAlignment="CENTER" wrapText="true">
