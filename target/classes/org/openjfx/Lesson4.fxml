It is just transferred from one form to another. Its standard unit is Joules (J) but it can also be measured in calories.&#13;&#13;• Kinetic Energy&#13;○ Like work, the kinetic energy of a particle is a scalar quantity.&#13;○ ½ m/v^2&#13;○ Kinetic energy can never be negative, and it is zero only when the particle is at rest.&#13;○ Kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the total work that was done to accelerate it from rest to its present speed." textAlignment="CENTER" wrapText="true">
